Aufgabe 3.2
	Test output of equals() on positions of a 20x20 board: 2/2
	Test output of hashCode() on positions of a 20x20 board: 8/8
Total points for Aufgabe 3.2: 10/10

Aufgabe 3.3
	Test output of equals(): 4/4
	Test consistency of hashCode() with a correct equals() method: 5/5
	Test distribution of hashCode() values (on asmall data set): 5/5
	Test distribution of hashCode() values (and timeout may indicate insufficient running time): 5/5
	Test whether equals() was implemented based on hashCode(), which it shouldn't: 0/1
	  java.lang.AssertionError: Method equals() does not work as expceted.
We called equals() for two different boards, for which hashCode() returns the same value.
Since the boards are not equal, method equals() needs to return 'false', but yours returned 'true'.
With such an equals() method, the bfs would not work.
Total points for Aufgabe 3.3: 19/20

Aufgabe 3.4
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for tiny boards: 5/5
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for boards of type XS: 10/10
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for boards of type S: 15/15
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for boards of type M: 20/20
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for boards of type L: 0/20
	  java.lang.AssertionError: Method 'bfsWithHashing()' does not return the expected result.
We called bfsWithHashing() for board 'tests/samples/rrBoard-C3-6x4-02.txt' which can be downloaded from https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/8B5tDQJ6e2swtkP.
The shortest solution has 27 moves, while your returned a move sequence containing 28 moves.Note, that a timeout may indicate that the method is not efficient (e.g. if hashing is not working properly).
Total points for Aufgabe 3.4: 50/70

Total points: 79/100
